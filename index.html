								<h1>Hi. I'm <strong>Zhenhui Cathy Trinh</strong>.</h1>
							</header>
							<p>I am an enthusiastic data analyst/scientist with over 5 years of experience.
								My love for data takes me on a continuous journey through its lifecycle, covering everything from data collection and rigorous cleaning to advanced analytics, captivating visual storytelling, and transformative machine learning. </p>
                            <p>My specialty lies in the population health and insurance domains, where I harness the power of SQL, R, Python, PySpark, and Tableau to extract valuable insights. 
								These insights form the bedrock of data-driven strategies that translate into tangible, real-world impacts.</p>
							<p>Beyond the realm of data, I enjoy a diverse range of activities, such as hiking, cooking, reading, and continuously expanding my knowledge. 
								In fact, I recently achieved a 100-day streak in my journey to learn the French language in <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/profile/Chat458124?via=share_profile">duolingo</a>.
								I've also dedicated time to honing my web development skills, using HTML and CSS to build this website!</p>
							<p>Thank you for visiting my website. I'm excited to share more about my data-driven adventures, personal interests, and the remarkable insights I encounter on this ever-evolving journey. Feel free to explore, connect, and join me on this voyage of discovery.</p>
